          liable. We do not guarantee the date of service provision, the date of
          the test, or product delivery, as this may change. In some cases, this
          will be affected by the efficiency of third-party services and our
          delivery partners. In this agreement, you expressly acknowledge and
          fully accept that your order is only related to the provision of
          products or services, that is, the consent of "test", the processing
          of "card application" or the delivery of material order revisions

        <h2>We accept orders in two ways:</h2>
        <br></br>
        <h3>Telephone Booking-</h3>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          You can call our helpline and place an order with our sales
          representative. The phone booking for the test appointment will be
          confirmed immediately and arranged in the appointment you selected.
          All telephone information provided by our agents is purely objective

          All suggestions and services are based on the information you provide
          to our agent. You must make every effort to ensure that you provide as
          much relevant information as possible so that we can provide you with
          correct information and accurate test bookings. Any wrong phone
          bookings due to misleading information provided to our agents will not
          be refunded or cancelled. If the agent is at fault, the order will be

        <h2>CITB Tests:</h2>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Since test bookings are made on a live system, they are subject to
          availability and are made on a first-come, first-served basis without
          any reservation or hold in place. Bookings are only confirmed once
          payment has been received. If a booking was made online after 7 pm
          Monday through Friday and 4 pm on Saturday, it will be confirmed the
          following working day. We will confirm Sunday bookings on Monday.
          During the booking call, our sales agent will take your information
          about the test for which you want to appear, What is the preferred day
          for your exam to take place, what your associate trade is, if you hold
          any construction qualifications, membership of any construction
          organizations (if applicable), When making a payment over the phone,
          you will be asked to provide your debit or credit card information. We
          transfer the order after the payment has been received and confirmed
          to our back-office team who finds out if the test date is available
          and books the test on that friend's behalf if it suits the customer.
          To confirm the dates, times, and locations of the scheduled exam, a
          confirmation letter/email will be sent to you. We will offer you
          another date if your preferred one is unavailable. You are responsible
          for ensuring that you provide the correct email address in case you do
          not receive any confirmation email. If you do not have a valid email
          address, then we will not send a confirmation by post. In the case
          where your preferred test date or time is unavailable, we cannot be
          held responsible, but we will make every effort to provide you with
          the next available date/ time at your preferred test center.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Online bookings made before 6 pm Mon-Fri will be confirmed the same
          day. Any bookings placed on Saturday/Sunday will be confirmed on
          Monday. It is your responsibility to take the exam at the right time
          and on the right day. Test bookings are made on a real-time system and
          follow the principle of "first come, first served". Once you have
          booked an exam, you cannot cancel the exam unless you request it 4
          working days before the actual exam date. When booking online, the
          date and time you choose online cannot be guaranteed as they are

          change. You need a valid photo ID (valid passport/driver's license).

          waiver form with you to the test center. If you do not have a valid
          ID, it is your responsibility to notify us so that we can send you a
          waiver form. Once you have booked the exam and you have received the
          booking confirmation email, all other products in the offer (such as
          courses or cards) are non-refundable.

          retake option is only available for 60 days after the first test of
          your original booking. If you pass the first test, your retake fees
          will not be refunded. The fee is non-transferable to another test.

          purchase to you. Your money will be debited from your source after the
          "confirm and checkout" stage. If we're not able to deliver the product
          that you have ordered, we will contact you by telephone [and/or
          e-mail] to offer you either a full refund or a replacement product. If
          we do not receive a response from you within 24 hours of our first try
          and touch you, we will refund the entire amount from your debited
          source. We will ensure that the prices on our website are transparent
          and accurate. Still, mistakes happen. If we found a mistake in your
          order related to cost, we will be in touch with you. If any product or
          service charged is higher than what is mentioned on our website, we
          will follow the lower fees mentioned and charge you accordingly, and
          will send you confirmation. If a product or service cost mentioned on
          our website is lower than the actual cost we will ask to continue the
          purchase on actual cost or cancel the order affected by errors. we are
          able to deem the order canceled if we do now not receive a response
          from you within 24 hours of our first try to contact you. In cases
          like this, we will refund the whole amount debited from your sources.
